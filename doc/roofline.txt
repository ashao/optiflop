Floating point microbenchmarks for Raijin


Motivation
==========

The purpose of these microbenchmarks is to provide the baseline parameters for
a `roofline performance model`_.  Roofline models relate model performance,
typically FLOPs per second, to the memory bandwidth required for the
calculation, or the *arithmetic intensity*.  The arithmetic intensity is
typically defined as number of FLOPS that can be performed per bytes
transferred from memory (usually DRAM).

An example roofline diagram for a single CPU core on Raijin is shown in the
figure below.

The figure illustrates the peak FLOP performance as a function of arithmetic
intensity.
