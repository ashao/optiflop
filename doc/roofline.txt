Floating point microbenchmarks for Raijin


Motivation
==========

The purpose of these microbenchmarks is to provide the baseline parameters for
a `roofline performance model`_.  Roofline models relate model performance,
typically FLOPs per second, to the memory bandwidth required for the
calculation, or the *arithmetic intensity*.  The arithmetic intensity is
typically defined as number of FLOPS that can be performed per bytes
transferred from memory (usually DRAM).

An example roofline diagram for a single CPU core on Raijin is shown in the
figure below.

The figure illustrates the peak FLOP performance as a function of arithmetic
intensity.  Tasks which require many calculations over a limited data set, such
as DFTs or dense matrix solvers, will have a high arithmetic intensity and be
bounded by the computational speed of the CPU, denoted by the solid horizontal
line.  Smaller, more contained calculations, such as vector updates or PDE
stencil approximations, will have much lower arithmetic intensity and will be
bounded by memory transfers, such that the CPU is waiting on new data to
calculate, which are denoted by the sloped curves on the left.
